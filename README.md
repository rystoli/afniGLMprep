# afniGLMprep
afniGLMprep is python code which prepares and runs GLMs on neuroimaging data stored in the [BIDS format](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/). This is done via AFNI's 3dDeconvolve function. *For the record, it works great with [fmriprep](https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep)!*

## Purpose
Standardized structures for neuroimaging data have allowed the development of tools which perform various functions and analyses on data with relative automaticity and ease. The [BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure)](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/) has many tools for preprocessing and analysis of data (e.g., [BIDS apps](http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/)). Here is an initial set of functions to run first-level analyses via GLM on fMRI data. Specifically, this code automates generation of AFNI files and scripts necessary to estimate whole-brain response patterns to experimental conditions. 

In its current form, it gives whole-brain activation patterns per conditions, per functional 4D brain data. 

It reduces this large effort to a single line of code:
```
python afniGLMprep_run.py csvInput prep1D prepGLM
```

## Installation
1. Download these files (via git clone or direct download links):
```
git clone https://github.com/rystoli/afniGLMprep.git
```
2. afniGLMprep is best run via command line, see documentation below.
3. However, if you wish to use individual functions etc., package installation via pip is available by specifying the package directory filepath:
```
pip install afniGLMprep
```
4. Then import, and navigate functions and parameters via:
```
import afniglmprep as agp
print( dir(agp.apf) )   # apf = afniglmprep functions
print( dir(agp.p)   )   # p   = afniglmprep params
```

## Specific Functions 
* Generates AFNI 3dDeconvolve scripts per functional dataset specified
* Generates AFNI 1D stimulus onset timing files for GLM design matrices (input for 3dDeconvolve)
* Generates AFNI 1D nuisance regressors of no interest (motion, global signal, white matter)

## Requirements
* You need to have write permissions for your BIDS directory for everything to work properly
* Uses several scientific python libraries (pandas, numpy)
* Data must be stored in the BIDS format. All functions require very specific directory structures and file names.
* Stimulus onset timing files (1Ds) are made from BIDS formatted \*events.tsv files
* If you intend to use them, nuisance regressors (e.g., motion parameters) must be in \*confounds.tsv files (see below)

## Content
* afniGLMprep_run.py: command-line script to execute functions (see instructions below)
* afniGLMprep_params.py: text file where user specifies input and analysis parameters
* afniGLMprep_functions.py: functions used to generate analysis files
* afniGLMprep_input.csv: optional file to specify input to afniGLMprep

## Preparation
* Assumes all files to be operated on are under the 'BIDS_path' directory, that is, the BIDS organized dataset top directory (containing all subject data etc.; protip - use explicit filepaths, not environment variables, e.g., tild ~)
* Experimental conditions to be estimated (design matrix columns) come from events.tsv files. One is required per functional input dataset you wish to execute the GLM on (so if you have a constant design, simply duplicate the files and name them appropriately in BIDS format).
    - e.g., '/BIDS_folder/sub-01/func/sub-01_task-taskname_run-01_events.tsv'
* If you would like to include nuisance regressors (motion, etc.) in your model, a confounds.tsv file must also be specified per functional input dataset. This tsv file must have a column for each nuisance regressor and the number of rows in each column must be equal to the total number of functional volumes in the corresponding functional input dataset. One nuisance regressor (modeled using the -stim_file and -stim_base options in 3dDeconvolve) will be added to the model for each column in the tsv. The naming convention must conform to the general BIDS format, e.g.:
    - '/BIDS_folder/sub-01/func/sub-01_task-taskname_run-01_bold_desc-confounds.tsv' ([fmriprep](https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep) produces these automatically in this format)
    - Set 'regressOut' in the afniGLMprep_params.py to 1
    - *Currently only work with csvInput option*
    - Created by [Jeff Brooks](https://jeffreyallenbrooks.github.io/)
* Input datasets must be named in BIDS format, and placed in directories with subject functional data. If using preprocessed data (obv), it is recommended you use the same filename as the raw data in the /func/ directory, with a suffix 
    - e.g., 'preprocfinal', e.g., '/BIDS_folder/sub-01/func/sub-01_task-taskname_run-01_bold_preprocfinal.nii.gz'
*note, it is recommended user-specified strings in filenames (e.g., task names, suffixes) do not overlap with strings in filenames as part of the BIDS format (e.g., 'events', 'run', 'bold'), as BIDS filenames are split to navigate and produce files*
* GLM parameters (for 3dDeconvolve scripts) should be specified or checked in 'afniGLMprep_params.py'
* Input (which functional datasets, events files, and masks) should be specified in one of two ways:
    1. It may automatically be generated, assuming it is to be created for all '\*event.tsv' files in subject/func/ directories. If this is the case, make sure to specify 'input_suffix' and 'mask_path', then include 'prepInput' in arguments for afniGLMprep_run.py (see below)
    2. Specify in 'afniGLMprep_input.csv' (see example 'afniGLMprep_input.csv' in example_input directory; specify input.csv path in afniGLMprep_params.py). Each row is specifications to prep a GLM for one functional data input file, with its corresponding stimulus onset timings and mask. You must have columns specifying:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• 'func_input_path': path to functional input data files<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• 'eventTSV_path': path to events.tsv files<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• 'mask_path': path to mask within which data will be analyzed for a given run<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• 'confoundsTSV_path' (optional): path to confounds.tsv files<br/>
*note: currently requires a mask, though this may be the same for all subjects if you want.* <br/>
*note: many strings (paths,input files,strings in TSVs etc) are used to determine paths for afniGLMprep to function, so make sure to use plain-text, and avoid characters that my confuse filepaths, such as slashes (/,\), special characters etc.*

## Execution
Execution is easily done from the command-line. After parameters are set in afniGLMprep_params.py, simply run the 'afniGLMprep_run.py', along with arguments which specify the actions you would like completed. You may enter as many actions as you would like, but must at least specify one action command: e.g., 'prep1D' or 'prepGLM'. The options at this time are:
* 'prepInput': prep input_dict of all functional runs to prepare the GLM for
* 'csvInput': prep input_dict of all functional runs to prepare the GLM for from input CSV
* 'prep1D': prep AFNI 1D stimulus onset timing files
* 'prepGLM': prep AFNI 3dDeconvolve scripts<br/><br/>
Example calls:
```
python afniGLMprep_run.py prepInput prep1D
python afniGLMprep_run.py prepInput prep1D prepGLM 
python afniGLMprep_run.py csvInput prep1D prepGLM 
```

## Output
* Stimulus onset timing files (1Ds) are placed in a directory 'GLM_1Ds' in the BIDS home folder you specified in afniGLMprep_params.py
* AFNI 3dDeconvolve scripts are placed in the BIDS home folder specified in afniGLMprep_params.py

Feel free to try it out on public [BIDS example datasets](https://github.com/INCF/BIDS-examples)! Just remember to format accordingly above (e.g., replace any inappropriate characters 

## To-do / Limitations
* Create fully flexible 3dDeconvolve script generation, allowing user to add additional parameters
* Create additional forms of 3dDeconvolve, eg, if user prefers more advanced models, or estimates per onset/trial
* Allow option to begin analyses
* Print out more detailed summary of what is used: params + stim_times conditions
* Provide more debugging feedback 
* Full documentation of functions
* Is 'regressOut' necessary?
* iresps not saving to correct location
